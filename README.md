###

Todo:

1. Suggest some style configs (Vue style, high contrast, plain, colourful)

Broad goals:

1. NPM packaged, vue pluggable with readme, examples and prebuilt styles using essentially the same as the vue-router config
2. Full customisation of the visual styles
3. Good customisation of the functional styles

Shows:

1. Community engagement
2. Style customisation
3. Interactive SVG

Stretch:

1. Toggle between styles (nested squares, radial)
2. Using voice navigation
3. Refactor the recursion of the components, fair amount of duplication
4. Allow configuration when registering the component, overriding with props.
5. Start expanded children
6. Allow buttons to be focusable/disable the panning
7. Animate expand/shrink from the center
8. Play animations on load, as a feature toggle
9. Ripple out from mouse click instead of from center
